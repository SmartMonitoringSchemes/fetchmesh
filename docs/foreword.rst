Foreword
========

fetchmesh is a Python library and a command-line tool for working with RIPE Atlas measurements.
More specifically, it focuses on the *anchoring mesh measurements*, the periodic measurements between every pairs of anchors.
In the latest versions, the scope of fetchmesh increased to include BGP collectors and PeeringDB IXP data.
fetchmesh is a complex tool and I tried my best to keep the code readable, documented and tested.
Unfortunately there is always more to do than time allows.
The adventurous reader is encouraged to read the source code, and make the appropriate changes if need be.
